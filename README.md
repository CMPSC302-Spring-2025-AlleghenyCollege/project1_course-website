# Project 1: Course Website

## Objective

Collaboratively enhance the course website, [designingtheweb.org](https://designingtheweb.org/), 
to improve functionality, design, and accessibility. The incremental project tasks will align with weekly 
topics covered in the course. Additionally, the website should be designed as an open-source educational 
platform for any learner to learn web design.

## Overview

- **Project Duration:** Full semester
- **Team Size:** 3-4 students per group
- **Deliverables:** Incremental updates to the website, documentation of the development process, and engagement in software engineering practices.
- **Repository:** Planning and prototyping will be done in `project1` repository. Website work will be done in branches of the course website GitHub repository.

## Project Learning Outcomes

- Apply design and development principles from the course to improve the website.
- Enhance user experience (UX), accessibility, and visual appeal.
- Ensure functionality, responsiveness, and maintainability.
- Practice collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

### Connection to Course and Distribution Learning Outcomes

The project learning outcomes apply to all course and distribution learning outcomes reproduced below.

- **Course Learning Outcomes:**
  - Apply HTML, CSS, Markdown, and basic Javascript to develop well-structured, responsive World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards-compliant web sites.
  - Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
  - Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
  - Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.

- **Distribution Learning Outcomes:**
  - **IP: International & Intercultural Perspectives (IP):**
    - Demonstrate an understanding of cultural complexity and difference.
  - **SP: Scientific Process & Knowledge (SP):**
    - Demonstrate an understanding of the nature, approaches, and domain of scientific inquiry.

## Project Milestones

Project milestones will be released as sprints as the semester progresses. The first sprint requirements include planning and prototyping as described below.

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 2-4): Planning
### DUE: February 3, 2025

- **Overall Tasks:**
  - General design audit: Evaluate the overall website's UI/UX to suggest basic improvements like layout, typography, and structure.
  - Testing: Make sure the website and its components function as intended.
  - Responsiveness and mobile-first improvements: Ensure the website works well on mobile devices.
  - Content: Decide the type and the organization of content for learning web design, keeping in mind that a lot of new learning content must be added. 
  - Wireframing: Use Figma to create a website representation with new features and improvements.
  - GitHub setup and version control: Set up repositories, practice basic GitHub workflows, and organize the repository for future use.

- **Individual Tasks:**
  - Each team member should be assigned a specific task to work on.
  - Work in individual branches in your team's `project1` repository and create pull requests (PRs) for review and approval. Must obtain at least two approvals before merge. 

- **Agile Workflow:**
  - Set up a project board with all tasks to complete and assign tasks to members of the team.
  - Conduct regular meetings to discuss progress and plan next steps. This includes stand-up meetings at the beginning of each class.
  - Follow agile methodology with sprints, including sprint planning and sprint reviews. 

- **Deliverables:**
  - Clone the course website repository and set up a local development environment. Set up [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and demonstrate that you can run [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) locally. Each individual must show the instructor that they can render the course website from VSCode to receive a checkmark for this first task in sprint 1.
  - Set up and maintain a project board.
  - Conduct a website audit focusing on:
    - Accessibility (e.g., contrast, screen reader support)
    - Responsiveness (mobile vs. desktop views)
    - Navigation and user flow
    - Functionality
  - Submit a report summarizing findings in `report.md`.
  - Submit a short proposal outlining potential new features and improvements in `proposal.md`.
  - Submit a wireframing representation of the proposed course website.
  - Present your proposed website on February 3rd.
  - Work as a whole class to determine which proposed features and improvements will be made for next sprint. 

## Assessment Criteria

- **Participation and Engagement**
  - Active participation in team meetings and discussions.
  - Regular contributions to the project board and task assignments.

- **Task Completion**
  - Completion of assigned tasks in individual branches.
  - Creation and approval of pull requests (PRs) with at least two reviews.

- **Deliverables**
  - Submission of a comprehensive website audit report (`report.md`).
  - Submission of a detailed proposal for new features and improvements (`proposal.md`).
  - Submission of wireframing representations using Figma.
  - Presentation of the proposed website on February 3rd.

- **Collaboration and Process**
  - Effective use of Git and GitHub for collaboration.
  - Evidence of peer feedback and teamwork.

- **Documentation and Presentation**
