# Sprint 1 (Weeks 2-4): Planning
### DUE: February 3, 2025

## Overall Tasks
- General design audit: Evaluate the overall website's UI/UX to suggest basic improvements like layout, typography, and structure.
- Testing: Make sure the website and its components function as intended.
- Responsiveness and mobile-first improvements: Ensure the website works well on mobile devices.
- Content: Decide the type and the organization of content for learning web design, keeping in mind that a lot of new learning content must be added. 
- Wireframing: Use Figma to create a website representation with new features and improvements.
- GitHub setup and version control: Set up repositories, practice basic GitHub workflows, and organize the repository for future use.

## Individual Tasks
- Each team member should be assigned a specific task to work on.
- Work in individual branches in your team's `project1` repository and create pull requests (PRs) for review and approval. Must obtain at least two approvals before merge. 

## Agile Workflow
- Set up a project board with all tasks to complete and assign tasks to members of the team.
- Conduct regular meetings to discuss progress and plan next steps. This includes stand-up meetings at the beginning of each class.
- Follow agile methodology with sprints, including sprint planning and sprint reviews. 

## Deliverables
- Clone the course website repository and set up a local development environment. Set up [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and demonstrate that you can run [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) locally. Each individual must show the instructor that they can render the course website from VSCode to receive a checkmark for this first task in sprint 1.
- Set up and maintain a project board.
- Conduct a website audit focusing on:
  - Accessibility (e.g., contrast, screen reader support)
  - Responsiveness (mobile vs. desktop views)
  - Navigation and user flow
  - Functionality
- Submit a report summarizing findings in `report.md`.
- Submit a short proposal outlining potential new features and improvements in `proposal.md`.
- Submit a wireframing representation of the proposed course website.
- Present your proposed website on February 3rd.
- Work as a whole class to determine which proposed features and improvements will be made for next sprint.
